MagicArrows
===========

Bukkit plugin that adds special functions for bows triggered by using the bow while 
certain items are next to it on the hotbar.

Use a bow and arrow to perform tasks you never thought possible!
Place torches in faraway locations, blow up everything with explosive arrows,
and spread fire with fire arrows that actually burn! Maybe you could even control the weather?

Inspired in part by Risugami's elemental arrows mod and one of sk89q's skcraft-exclusive plugins
